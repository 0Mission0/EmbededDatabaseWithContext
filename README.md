# EmbededDatabaseWithContext
In-Memory Database Example with Spring (Configured by XML)

Same as [EmbeddedDatabaseExample](https://github.com/0Mission0/EmbeddedDatabaseExample), the main difference between them is only the way of configuration.

Use H2 In-Memory Database as demostration.

PS. With this simple sample, you can check the content of H2 in-mem db on H2 Console.
